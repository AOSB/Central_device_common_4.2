Quick document of things to try/do

- Add rotation matrices for both accelerometer and magnetometer sensors.
  These matrices can be used to rotate the coordinate system of the sensor
  to Device Coordinate System, and to calibrate down direction/magnitude
  exactly.

- Adaptation for jordan is not finished... but actually works, 
  KXTF9 should be integrated (Original version was for the 'hero')

  Sensors headers were updated from Defy Kernel 2.6.32 Sources

  I will check the BML150 implementation soon on the moto Atrix :p
